Statistical Inference for Qualitative Interactions with Applications to Precision Medicine and Differential Network Analysis

Implementation of methodology for assessing qualitative between-group differences in treatment effect.  This software can be used to perform a hypothesis test to identify when an effect differs in size between sub-group by a multiplicative constant, and to estimate the ratio of the effects.   For details, see the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08703).
